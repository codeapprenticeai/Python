# Part 1 - Make a list that includes at least 3 people

guest_list = []

guest_list.append('Jim')
guest_list.append('Ralph')
guest_list.append('Mike')

print(guest_list)


# Little bit of cheating on this task, but i think i have learnt in my days of powershell if you know of a shorter way of doing this, DO IT!

for guest in guest_list:
    print(f"I would like to formally invite {guest} to my dinner party")
